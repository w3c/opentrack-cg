# OpenTrack – Open Tools for Athletics

This is the repository for [W3C OpenTrack Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/) to develop and document specifications and code related to OpenTrack. 

OpenTrack is a set of tools to increase interoperability among systems managing information on athletics and sports in general. OpenTrack includes schemas and vocabularies to describe sports, as well as open source software that helps managing that kind of information.

Through OpenTrack athletics entities around the world (sport clubs, federations, private event organizers, etc.) will be able to open the data contributing towards open data in sports. This will bring new business opportunities to third parties (developers, public bodies, private companies, citizens, academia). 

## What tools?

The main component of OpenTrack is a set of vocabularies and taxonomies that will help publishers to model and expose information regarding athletics (events, athletes, facilities, results, rankings, and others). 

Participants in this group will contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.

## Formats and standards

All documents will be encoded in UTF-8.

Schemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.
