                This specification, developed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/">W3C OpenTrack Community Group</a>, introduces a data model to support the publication of Athletics data on the Web. This document is based
                on the <a href="../model/">OpenTrack Abstract Data Model</a> that defines the main concepts and relations of Athletics competitions, including events schedule, competitors and other stakeholders, enabling a common
                representation of information in this sector.
            </p>

            <p>This OpenTrack vocabulary proposes an extension of Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]], producing a lightweight schema to identify, expose and process Athletics data on the Web.</p>

            <p>This Schema.org extension takes into account its current version, and continuing with the work done previously by the specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Sports">Sports Schema.org task force</a>.</p>

            <p>
                This proposal is based on the <a href="../model/">conceptual model for OpenTrack</a>. As described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html">the charter</a> of the Community Group, this model describes
                data related to Athletics competitions including: Track and Field; Road Running; Race Walking; Cross-Country Running; Mountain Running; and trail Running disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>This model is focus on Athletics competitions, having into account: events; athletes and teams; results; performances; management of start lists; results; and facilities.</p>
            <p>
                This document specifies a lightweight schema, based on Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] to represent the main concepts and relations about sports competitions, athletes, and other stakeholders as a common representation of
                information in this realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples are expressed in JSON-LD format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific JSON-LD context that will ease the adoption of the
                vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            <p>
                OpenTrack descriptions need homogeneous classes, properties and data types to specify values of properties. This work is based <a href="http://opentrack.run/standards/">on existing requirements</a>, and the rules set up by
                the IAAF [[IAAF-RULES]] and by WMA [[WMA-RULES]]. The core vocabulary is Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]].

            <h2 id="how-to-use-opentrack-with-json-ld">How to use OpenTrack with JSON-LD</h2>
            <p>
                With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in [[JSON-LD]] format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific [[JSON-LD]] context that will ease the
                adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.
            </p>
            <p>This section includes introductory information for those who are not familiar with the semantic technologies.</p>
            <p>
                The Opentrack model is expressed under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> paradigm (a graph-oriented representation), so there is more than one format to represent (serialize) the graph of information: RDF/XML,
                turtle, RDFa, etc. Examples will be represented in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>, a JSON-based syntax easy to adopt.
            </p>
            <p>In order to ease the adoption of this set of technologies, this document includes several recipes to help developers publish and reuse Athletics information through these mechanisms.</p>

                <h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JSON-LD</strong>. JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at
                        Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JSON-LD Context</strong>. In JSON-LD, a context is used to map terms, i.e., properties with associated values in an JSON document, to URLs. A term is a short word that expands to a URL. Terms may be defined
                        as any valid JSON string other than a JSON-LD keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked
                        Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)</strong>. An IRI is something like a unique web address (<a href="http://example.org/resource001">http://example.org/resource001</a>) that serves for identifying
                        resources.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>To illustrate the basic concepts of this Opentrack JSON-LD representation we will use a simple example with the description of an athlete:</p>
                <pre class="example">
{
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld",
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld",
    "@type" : "Athlete",
    "name" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah",
    "familyName" : "Farah",
    "givenName" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama",
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah",
    "url" : "http://www.mofarah.com",
    "gender" : "Male" ,
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23",
    "image" : "https://example.com/260px-MoPodiumRio2016.png",
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
} 


                </pre>

                <p>There are there keywords that should be always included in our documents: <code>@context</code>, <code>@type</code> and <code>@id</code>. The rest of the <strong>properties are optional</strong>.</p>
                <p>In case a property value is unknown, the pair key:value will be omitted.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4 id="context">@context</h4>
                    <p>
                        RDF resources (concepts, classes, properties, etc.) are identified by IRIs. For instance, the property <code>name</code> used in the example above is identified by <code>http://schema.org/name</code>. JSON-LD
                        contexts define keys used within the document can have unambigious meaning, as they bind to the IRIs which describe their meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>By specifying</p>
                    <pre>
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld"



                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        we indicate the context of the document, that is defined in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld">the linked document</a>. So we can use the keys of the context as a simplification for
                        the representation.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4 id="type">@type</h4>
                    <p>
                        <code>@type</code> indicates the class of the resource being described. In this example, the resource is an <code>Athlete</code> (the context maps <code>Athlete</code> to the IRI
                        <code>http://purl.org/athletics#Athlete</code>, but we don&#39;t care about this now).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We should include always the type to the object we are describing.</li>
                        <li>In case the resource would have more than a type, several types may be specified within an array:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre class="example">
    "@type" : [ "Athlete", "Coach" ]



                    </pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4 id="id">@id</h4>
                    <p><code>@id</code> is used to uniquely identify entities or resources through IRIs.</p>
                    <p>When dereferencing an entity related via a URL, the location should provide a representation of that entity.</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"



                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        This example describes an <code>Athlete</code> that is identified as
                        <a href='http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"'>http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld</a>. The web address will provide information about the entity (the
                        same that is being described in the example). Having these identifiers we will be able to refer this entity from other entity descriptions or documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using this mechanism, we can enrich descriptions just linking our descriptions with other IRIs that already identify resources. For instance, the athlete is affiliated to a club:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }



                    </pre>

                    <p>That club (identified by <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld">http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld</a>) is described in the same way.</p>
                    <p>
                        There may be exceptions of JSON-LD objects that <strong>do not</strong> have <code>@id</code>s associated. We should avoid this case unless we are sure the object defined is useful only in the context of the current
                        description (i.e., no reusable in future descriptions).
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h4 id="property-values">Property values</h4>
                    <p>Properties that describe resources may have values of different nature:</p>
                    <h5 id="literals">Literals</h5>
                    <p>Some properties only may have <strong>Literals</strong> as value:</p>
                    <p>Texts:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah"



                    </pre>

                    <p>Dates:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23"



                    </pre>

                    <p>Integers:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "age" : 25



                    </pre>

                    <h6 id="predefined-values-enumerations-">Predefined Values (enumerations)</h6>
                    <p>Some properties may have <strong>Enumerations</strong> as value:</p>
                    <p>For instance, <code>gender</code> should only take one possible value (either <code>Male</code> or <code>Female</code>).</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "gender" : "Male"



                    </pre>

                    <p>In this case, the potential values are expressed in the context as aliases, so we can use <code>Male</code> instead of <code>http://schema.org/Male</code>.</p>
                    <h5 id="objects">Objects</h5>
                    <p>As shown above, a resource identified by an IRI may be used as value of a property.</p>
                    <p>In case <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld">the resource</a> is already identified (and described) we can link it directly:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }



                    </pre>
                    <p>Otherwise we can describe that resource nested in the main object:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : {
        "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld",
        "@type": "Club",
        "name": "Newham &amp; Essex Beagles",
        "alternateName": "BeaglesAC",
        "url": "http://www.newhamandessexbeagles.co.uk/",
        "logo": "http://example.org/logo.png",
        "telephone": "(+44) 020 7511 6463",
        "faxNumber": "(+44) 020 7511 4477",
        "address": {
            "name": "Terence McMillan Stadium - Newham Leisure Centre",
            "streetAddress": "281 Prince Regent Lane",
            "addressLocality": "London",
            "postalCode": "E13 8SD",
            "addressCountry": "countrycode:GBR"
        }
    }



                    </pre>

                    <p>See in the previous example that we can include descriptions of other entities nested (i.e., postal address).</p>
                    <h5 id="arrays">Arrays</h5>
                    <p>Most of the properties may be repeated to describe the same resource. For instance, the athlete may be affiliated to two clubs:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" },
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld" }



                    </pre>
                    Or:
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : 
        [

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.iaaf.org/disciplines">According to IAAF</a>, Athletics events may be classified into: <em>Sprints</em>, <em>Middle/long distance</em>, <em>Hurdles</em>, <em>Road Running</em>, <em>Jumps</em>,
                    <em>Throws</em>, <em>Combined Events</em>, <em>Race Walks</em>, <em>Relays</em>, <em>Cross Country</em>, <em>Mountain Running</em> and <em>Ultra Running</em>. IOC ODF [[IOC-ODF]] uses:
                    <em>Races (track and road) and relays</em>, <em>Throws</em>, <em>Horizontal Jumps</em> and <em>Vertical Jumps</em>. <a href="http://opentrack.run/athlib/build/html/eventcodes.html">Athlib proposes codes</a> to represent
                    disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disciplines are described by specific features (i.e., throws disciplines, such as shot put, are defined by <em>weight</em>). So, having into account the features related to the competition, disciplines are modelled in
                    this taxonomy of concepts:

                <p>
                    Each country should be represented by an IRI that includes a unique three-character <em>Authority code</em>. It is recommended using the EU
                    <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html">Named Authority List (NAL) of Countries</a>, that relays on the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1/alpha-3</a> positions in case the country is present in the ISO standard. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are
                    also offered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IRI scheme of countries is <code>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/{countrycode}</code>. The JSON-LD context enables a <code>countrycode</code> prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of the
                    following form:
                </p>
                <pre class="example">
    countrycode:{countrycode}


                </pre>

                <p>For instance: <code>countrycode:ZWE</code> for <em>Zimbabwe</em>, <code>countrycode:ZAF</code> for <em>South Africa</em> and <code>countrycode:TGO</code> for <em>Togo</em>.</p>

                    If we need to represent a supranational spatial coverage (for instance, when defining the <code>areaServed</code> of organisations), it is recommended using the EU
                    <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/continent/html/continents-eng.html">Named Authority List (NAL) of Continents</a>. These are be represented in a similar way than countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IRI scheme of continents is <code>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/continent/{continentcode}</code>. The JSON-LD context enables a <code>continent</code> prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of
                    the following form:
                </p>
                <pre class="example">
    continent:{continentcode}


                </pre>

                <p>
                    Examples: <code>continent:AFRICA</code> for <em>Africa</em>, <code>continent:AMERICA</code> for <em>America</em>, <code>continent:ANTARCTICA</code> for <em>Antarctica</em>, <code>continent:ASIA</code> for <em>Asia</em>,
                    <code>continent:EUROPE</code> for <em>Europe</em> and <code>continent:OCEANIA</code> for <em>Oceania</em>.

                <p>
                    Like distance, wind speed must be represented by a quantified value, expressing the magnitude and kind of a quantity (unit). Values will be expressed as a numeric value (decimal or integer) and a measurement code. It is
                    recommended using the UN/CEFACT Common Codes [[UNECE-CODES]] for Codes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade. Typically, in Athletics wind speed assistance is represented in
                    <em>metres per second (m/s)</em>, recognized by the International System of Units (SI).
