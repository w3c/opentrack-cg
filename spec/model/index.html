                This specification, developed by [W3C OpenTrack Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/), introduces a data model to support the publication of Athletics data on the Web. This document defines the main
                concepts and relations of Athletics competitions, including competitors and their results, enabling a common representation of information in this sector.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Open Athletics model is mapped to existing standards, including BBC Sports Ontology [[SPORT-ONT]], Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]], [[QUDT-SPACETIME]] types and properties. The resulting Open Athletics Vocabulary is a
                lightweight schema aiming at identifying, defining and exposing data on the Web.

            <p>
                This model and vocabulary is in process of development.

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This section describes the conceptual model for Open Athletics. As described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html">the charter</a>, this model describes data related to Athletics competitions
                including: Track and Field; Road Running; Race Walking; Cross-Country Running; Mountain Running; and trail Running disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>This model will be focus on Athletics competitions, having into account: events; athletes and teams; results; performances; management of start lists; results; and facilities.</p>
            <p>
                This document specifies the model in an abstract way and its implementation using the concrete vocabulary, a lightweight schema, based on RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] and Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]]. Opentrack vocabulary defines
                the main concepts and relations about Athletics competitions and competitors, enabling a common representation of information in this realm. Data should be available in a standard format, reachable and manageable by Semantic
                Web tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in JSON-LD format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific JSON-LD context that will ease the adoption of
                the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

                <p>This specification is divided into two main sections:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Introduction</strong> - this introductory part;</li>

                    <li><strong>Classification Schemas</strong> - lists of taxonomies and value schemas related to Athletics.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Open Athletics descriptions need homogeneous classes, properties and data types to specify values of properties. This work is based <a href="http://opentrack.run/standards/">on existing requirements</a>, and the rules
                    set up by the IAAF [[IAAF-RULES]] and by WMA [[WMA-RULES]].
                </p>
                <p>Open Athletics vocabulary is aligned with other existing schemas and ontologies focused on sports, such as: Sport Ontology [[SPORT-ONT]], IPTC SportsML [[SPORTSML]] and Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]].</p>

            <h2 id="how-to-use-open-athletics-with-json-ld">How to use Open Athletics with JSON-LD</h2>
            <p>
                With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in [[JSON-LD]] format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific [[JSON-LD]] context that will ease the
                adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.
            </p>
            <p>This section includes introductory information for those who are not familiar with the semantic technologies.</p>
            <p>
                The Opentrack model is expressed under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> paradigm (a graph-oriented representation), so there is more than one format to represent (serialize) the graph of information: RDF/XML,
                turtle, RDFa, etc. Examples will be represented in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>, a JSON-based syntax easy to adopt.
            </p>
            <p>In order to ease the adoption of this set of technologies, this document includes several recipes to help developers publish and reuse Athletics information through these mechanisms.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JSON-LD</strong>. JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at
                        Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JSON-LD Context</strong>. In JSON-LD, a context is used to map terms, i.e., properties with associated values in an JSON document, to URLs. A term is a short word that expands to a URL. Terms may be defined
                        as any valid JSON string other than a JSON-LD keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Linked Data</strong>. Linked Data is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked
                        Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)</strong>. An IRI is something like a unique web address (<a href="http://example.org/resource001">http://example.org/resource001</a>) that serves for identifying
                        resources.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>To illustrate the basic concepts of this Opentrack JSON-LD representation we will use a simple example with the description of an athlete:</p>

    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld",

    "@type" : "Athlete",
    "name" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah",
    "familyName" : "Farah",

    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
} 


                </pre>

                <p>There are there keywords that should be always included in our documents: <code>@context</code>, <code>@type</code> and <code>@id</code>. The rest of the <strong>properties are optional</strong>.</p>
                <p>In case a property value is unknown, the pair key:value will be omitted.</p>

                    <h4 id="context">@context</h4>
                    <p>
                        RDF resources (concepts, classes, properties, etc.) are identified by IRIs. For instance, the property <code>name</code> used in the example above is identified by <code>http://schema.org/name</code>. JSON-LD
                        contexts define keys used within the document can have unambigious meaning, as they bind to the IRIs which describe their meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>By specifying</p>

                    <p>
                        we indicate the context of the document, that is defined in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld">the linked document</a>. So we can use the keys of the context as a simplification for
                        the representation.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4 id="type">@type</h4>
                    <p>
                        <code>@type</code> indicates the class of the resource being described. In this example, the resource is an <code>Athlete</code> (the context maps <code>Athlete</code> to the IRI
                        <code>http://purl.org/athletics#Athlete</code>, but we don&#39;t care about this now).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We should include always the type to the object we are describing.</li>
                        <li>In case the resource would have more than a type, several types may be specified within an array:</li>
                    </ul>

                    <pre class="example">
    "@type" : [ "Athlete", "Coach" ]

                <section>
                    <h4 id="id">@id</h4>
                    <p><code>@id</code> is used to uniquely identify entities or resources through IRIs.</p>
                    <p>When dereferencing an entity related via a URL, the location should provide a representation of that entity.</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"


                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        This example describes an <code>Athlete</code> that is identified as
                        <a href='http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"'>http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld</a>. The web address will provide information about the entity (the
                        same that is being described in the example). Having these identifiers we will be able to refer this entity from other entity descriptions or documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using this mechanism, we can enrich descriptions just linking our descriptions with other IRIs that already identify resources. For instance, the athlete is affiliated to a club:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }


                    </pre>

                    <p>That club (identified by <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld">http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld</a>) is described in the same way.</p>
                    <p>
                        There may be exceptions of JSON-LD objects that <strong>do not</strong> have <code>@id</code>s associated. We should avoid this case unless we are sure the object defined is useful only in the context of the current
                        description (i.e., no reusable in future descriptions).
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="property-values">Property values</h4>
                    <p>Properties that describe resources may have values of different nature:</p>

                    <h5 id="literals">Literals</h5>
                    <p>Some properties only may have <strong>Literals</strong> as value:</p>

                    <pre class="example">
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah"


                    </pre>

                    <p>Dates:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23"


                    </pre>

                    <p>Integers:</p>
                    <pre class="example">

                    <p>Some properties may have <strong>Enumerations</strong> as value:</p>
                    <p>For instance, <code>gender</code> should only take one possible value (either <code>Male</code> or <code>Female</code>).</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "gender" : "Male"


                    </pre>

                    <p>In this case, the potential values are expressed in the context as aliases, so we can use <code>Male</code> instead of <code>http://schema.org/Male</code>.</p>
                    <h5 id="objects">Objects</h5>
                    <p>As shown above, a resource identified by an IRI may be used as value of a property.</p>
                    <p>In case <a href="http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld">the resource</a> is already identified (and described) we can link it directly:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }


                    </pre>

                    <p>Otherwise we can describe that resource nested in the main object:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : {
        "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld",
        "@type": "Club",
        "name": "Newham &amp; Essex Beagles",
        "alternateName": "BeaglesAC",
        "url": "http://www.newhamandessexbeagles.co.uk/",
        "logo": "http://example.org/logo.png",
        "telephone": "(+44) 020 7511 6463",
        "faxNumber": "(+44) 020 7511 4477",

            "postalCode": "E13 8SD",
            "addressCountry": "countrycode:GBR"
        }
    }


                    </pre>

                    <p>See in the previous example that we can include descriptions of other entities nested (i.e., postal address).</p>
                    <h5 id="arrays">Arrays</h5>
                    <p>Most of the properties may be repeated to describe the same resource. For instance, the athlete may be affiliated to two clubs:</p>
                    <pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" },
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld" }


                    </pre>
                    Or:
                    <pre class="example">

                    <p>String properties may include information about its language, so we can include several representations of the same information in different languages.</p>
                    <p>
                        The property will include information about the textual information using a complex object with two keys: <code>@value</code> and <code>@language</code>. <code>@value</code> contains the string, and
                        <code>@language</code> the tag identifying the language (using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">Lenguage Tags</a>).

                <p>
                    All JSON-LD objects should have a <code>@type</code> explicitly indicating the class of the resource. The Opentrack vocabulary includes several classes that can be used, but also other external vocabularies may be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Classes may be described hierarchically to express differences in the model. For instance, Opentrack defines different types of competitions, with <a href="#competition">Competition</a> as the core entity that defines a
                    generic competitive sports event. <a href="#competition">Competition</a> has several subclasses: <em>Multi Stage Competition</em>, <em>Divisional Competition</em>, <em>Multi Round Competition</em>,
                    <em>Multidiscipline Competition</em> and <a href="#unit-competition">Unit Competition</a>. This means that instances of these subclasses will be also considered a <a href="#competition">Competition</a>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In case the author does not know the nature of the competition, by default they should use the most generic class (i.e., <a href="#competition">Competition</a>).</li>
                    <li>
                        A competition may categorized with more than a type. For instance 2016 Olympic Games could be a <em>Multidiscipline Competition</em> (100m, 200m, Throws, basketball, tennis, etc.) and a
                        <em>Divisional Competition</em> (divisions are disciplines and categories).

                        Competitor is the action of taking part in a competition. Competitor is either an athletes or a team that take part in an Athletics event, identified by specific information such as bib number, and best performance
                        for the specific discipline of the event. This entry information is relative to the competition and relevant for <a href="#results">Results</a>.

                        items will include information about the impact of the performance in the competition (i.e., records, disqualifications, competition &#39;under protest&#39;, etc.).

                        in centimetres). It may include information about the conditions in which competitor got the performance (e.g., wind speed).

                    measured as time, jumps and throws are measured in centimetres). It may include information about the conditions in which competitor got the performance (e.g., wind assistance).

                    <li><strong>Hand Timing</strong> (<code>HT</code>) – Hand Timing is usually given to 0.1 seconds (average the different timekeepers and rounded up);</li>
                    <li><strong>Fully Automatic Timing</strong> (<code>FAT</code>), obtained from a Photo Finish System (FAT usually given to 0.01 seconds);</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transponder System Timing</strong>. Automatic timing provided by radio signal devices. Road races use a variety of chip timing systems, precision is less important than recording thousands of people easily in

                <p>An <dfn>Athletics Discipline</dfn> is a particular type of Athletics event defined by specific rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.iaaf.org/disciplines">According to IAAF</a>, Athletics events may be classified into: <em>Sprints</em>, <em>Middle/long distance</em>, <em>Hurdles</em>, <em>Road Running</em>, <em>Jumps</em>,
                    <em>Throws</em>, <em>Combined Events</em>, <em>Race Walks</em>, <em>Relays</em>, <em>Cross Country</em>, <em>Mountain Running</em> and <em>Ultra Running</em>. IOC ODF [[IOC-ODF]] uses:
                    <em>Races (track and road) and relays</em>, <em>Throws</em>, <em>Horizontal Jumps</em> and <em>Vertical Jumps</em>. <a href="http://opentrack.run/athlib/build/html/eventcodes.html">Athlib proposes codes</a> to represent
                    disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disciplines are described by specific features (i.e., throws disciplines, such as shot put, are defined by <em>weight</em>). So, having into account the features related to the competition, disciplines are modelled in
                    this taxonomy of concepts:

                    <p>
                        Milliseconds should be enough to represent all time measurements in Athletics according to IAAF&#39;s rules [[IAAF-RULES]]. In the case of timing systems capturing higher resolution of time, values must be
                        represented as quantified values using the Space and Time Units Vocabulary [[QUDT-SPACETIME]]. Editors may indicate the magnitude as a numeric value and the kind of the quantity (unit). Any unit of measurement may be
                        used (hour, second, millisecond, etc.), but <em>it is recommended using the &#39;second&#39;</em> (s), as it is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI).

                    Each country should be represented by an IRI that includes a unique three-character <em>Authority code</em>. It is recommended using the EU
                    <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html">Named Authority List (NAL) of Countries</a>, that relays on the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1/alpha-3</a> positions in case the country is present in the ISO standard. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are
                    also offered.

                    The IRI scheme of countries is <code>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/{countrycode}</code>. The JSON-LD context enables a <code>countrycode</code> prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of the
                    following form:

                <pre class="example">
    countrycode:{countrycode}


                </pre>

                <p>For instance: <code>countrycode:ZWE</code> for <em>Zimbabwe</em>, <code>countrycode:ZAF</code> for <em>South Africa</em> and <code>countrycode:TGO</code> for <em>Togo</em>.</p>

                    If we need to represent a supranational spatial coverage (for instance, when defining the <code>areaServed</code> of organisations), it is recommended using the EU
                    <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/continent/html/continents-eng.html">Named Authority List (NAL) of Continents</a>. These are be represented in a similar way than countries.

                    The IRI scheme of continents is <code>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/continent/{continentcode}</code>. The JSON-LD context enables a <code>continent</code> prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of

                <p>
                    Like distance, wind speed must be represented by a quantified value, expressing the magnitude and kind of a quantity (unit). Values will be expressed as a numeric value (decimal or integer) and a measurement code. It is
                    recommended using the UN/CEFACT Common Codes [[UNECE-CODES]] for Codes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade. Typically, in Athletics wind speed assistance is represented in
                    <em>metres per second (m/s)</em>, recognized by the International System of Units (SI).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Metre per second (m/s): <code>MTS</code></li>

    "@type" : "QuantitativeValue",
    "value" : "0.22",

                <p>Other unit codes, such as knot (<code>KNT</code>) can be used if needed. Check and select the correspondent code from the <a href="../references/rec20_Rev9e_2014.xls">UN/CEFACT Common Codes</a> list.</p>
