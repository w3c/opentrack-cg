## Introduction

This section describes the conceptual model for OpenTrack. As described in [the charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html), this model describes data related to Athletics competitions including: Track and Field; Road Running; Race Walking; Cross-Country Running; Mountain Running; and trail Running disciplines.

This model will be focus on Athletics competitions, having into account: events; athletes and teams; results; performances; management of start lists; results; and facilities.

This document specifies the model in an abstract way and its implementation using the concrete vocabulary, a lightweight schema, based on RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] and Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]]. Opentrack vocabulary defines the main concepts and relations about Athletics competitions and competitors, enabling a common representation of information in this realm. Data should be available in a standard format, reachable and manageable by Semantic Web tools. 

With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in JSON-LD format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific JSON-LD context that will ease the adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

No section should be considered final, and the absence of any content does not imply that such content is out of scope, or may not appear in the future. If you feel something should be covered, please [tell us](https://github.com/w3c/opentrack-cg/issues).

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction** - this introductory part;
2. **How to** - How to use the model and describe resources using OpenTrack and JSON-LD;
3. **Concepts** - describes the key entities and their attributes, including the concrete data model;
4. **Classification Schemas** - lists of taxonomies and value schemas related to Athletics.
 
## Background

OpenTrack descriptions need homogeneous classes, properties and data types to specify values of properties. This work is based [on existing requirements](http://opentrack.run/standards/), and the rules set up by the IAAF [[IAAF-RULES]] and by WMA [[WMA-RULES]].

OpenTrack vocabulary is aligned with other existing schemas and ontologies focused on sports, such as: Sport Ontology [[SPORT-ONT]], IPTC SportsML [[SPORTSML]] and Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]].

## How to use OpenTrack with JSON-LD

With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in [[JSON-LD]] format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific [[JSON-LD]] context that will ease the adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

This section includes introductory information for those who are not familiar with the semantic technologies.

The Opentrack model is expressed under the [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) paradigm (a graph-oriented representation), so there is more than one format to represent (serialize) the graph of information: RDF/XML, turtle, RDFa, etc. Examples will be represented in [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), a JSON-based syntax easy to adopt.

In order to ease the adoption of this set of technologies, this document includes several recipes to help developers publish and reuse Athletics information through these mechanisms. 

### Terminology

* **JSON-LD**. JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.
* **JSON-LD Context**. In JSON-LD, a context is used to map terms, i.e., properties with associated values in an JSON document, to URLs. A term is a short word that expands to a URL. Terms may be defined as any valid JSON string other than a JSON-LD keyword.
* **Linked Data**. Linked Data is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.
* **IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)**. An IRI is something like a unique web address (http://example.org/resource001) that serves for identifying resources.

See [JSON-LD Best Practices](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api-best-practices/#terminology) for more information.

### Filename extension, MIME type and encoding

* Recommended document extension: `.jsonld`
* MIME Type: `application/ld+json`
* Encoding: `UTF-8`


### Basic JSON-LD concepts

To illustrate the basic concepts of this Opentrack JSON-LD representation we will use a simple example with the description of an athlete:

<pre class="example">
{
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld",
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld",
    "@type" : "Athlete",
    "name" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah",
    "familyName" : "Farah",
    "givenName" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama",
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah",
    "url" : "http://www.mofarah.com",
    "gender" : "Male" ,
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23",
    "image" : "https://example.com/260px-MoPodiumRio2016.png",
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
} 
</pre>

There are there keywords that should be always included in our documents: `@context`, `@type` and `@id`. The rest of the **properties are optional**. 

In case a property value is unknown, the pair key:value will be omitted. 

#### @context

RDF resources (concepts, classes, properties, etc.) are identified by IRIs. For instance, the property `name` used in the example above is identified by `http://schema.org/name`. JSON-LD contexts define keys used within the document can have unambigious meaning, as they bind to the IRIs which describe their meaning.

By specifying 
<pre>
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld"
</pre>

we indicate the context of the document, that is defined in [the linked document](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld). So we can use the keys of the context as a simplification for the representation. 

#### @type

`@type` indicates the class of the resource being described. In this example, the resource is an `Athlete` (the context maps `Athlete` to the IRI `http://purl.org/athletics#Athlete`, but we don't care about this now).

* We should include always the type to the object we are describing. 
* In case the resource would have more than a type, several types may be specified within an array:

<pre class="example">
    "@type" : [ "Athlete", "Coach" ]
</pre>

#### @id

`@id` is used to uniquely identify entities or resources through IRIs. 

When dereferencing an entity related via a URL, the location should provide a representation of that entity. 

<pre class="example">
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"
</pre>

This example describes an `Athlete` that is identified as [http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"). The web address will provide information about the entity (the same that is being described in the example). Having these identifiers we will be able to refer this entity from other entity descriptions or documents.

Using this mechanism, we can enrich descriptions just linking our descriptions with other IRIs that already identify resources. For instance, the athlete is affiliated to a club:

<pre class="example">
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
</pre>

That club (identified by [http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld)) is described in the same way.

There may be exceptions of JSON-LD objects that **do not** have `@id`s associated. We should avoid this case unless we are sure the object defined is useful only in the context of the current description (i.e., no reusable in future descriptions). 


#### Property values

Properties that describe resources may have values of different nature:

##### Literals

Some properties only may have **Literals** as value:   

Texts:
<pre class="example">
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah"
</pre>

Dates:
<pre class="example">
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23"
</pre>

Integers:
<pre class="example">
    "age" : 25
</pre>

###### Predefined Values (enumerations)

Some properties may have **Enumerations** as value:   

For instance, `gender` should only take one possible value (either `Male` or `Female`).
<pre class="example">
    "gender" : "Male"
</pre>

In this case, the potential values are expressed in the context as aliases, so we can use `Male` instead of `http://schema.org/Male`.


##### Objects

As shown above, a resource identified by an IRI may be used as value of a property. 

In case [the resource](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld) is already identified (and described) we can link it directly:
<pre class="example">
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
</pre>

Otherwise we can describe that resource nested in the main object:
<pre class="example">
    "club" : {
        "@type": "Club",
        "name": "Newham &amp; Essex Beagles",
        "alternateName": "BeaglesAC",
        "url": "http://www.newhamandessexbeagles.co.uk/",
        "logo": "http://example.org/logo.png",
        "telephone": "(+44) 020 7511 6463",
        "faxNumber": "(+44) 020 7511 4477",
        "address": {
            "name": "Terence McMillan Stadium - Newham Leisure Centre",
            "streetAddress": "281 Prince Regent Lane",
            "addressLocality": "London",
            "postalCode": "E13 8SD",
            "addressCountry": "country:GBR"
        }
    }
</pre>

See in the previous example that we can include descriptions of other entities nested (i.e., postal address).

##### Arrays

Most of the properties may be repeated to describe the same resource. For instance, the athlete may be affiliated to two clubs:

<pre class="example">
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld",
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld"
</pre>
Or: 
<pre class="example">
    "club" : [ 
        "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld",
        "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld"
    ]
</pre>

### Multilingual Descriptions

String properties may include information about its language, so we can include several representations of the same information in different languages. 

The property will include information about the textual information using a complex object with two keys: `@value` and `@language`. `@value` contains the string, and `@language` the tag identifying the language (using [Lenguage Tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)).

<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "Place",
    "name" : {
        "@value": "Berlin Olympic Stadium",
        "@language": "en"
    },
    "name": {
        "@value": "Olympiastadion Berlin",
        "@language": "de"
    }
}
</pre>

### Typed Objects

All JSON-LD objects should have a `@type` explicitly indicating the class of the resource. The Opentrack vocabulary includes several classes that can be used, but also other external vocabularies may be used. 

Classes may be described hierarchically to express differences in the model. For instance, Opentrack defines different types of competitions, with [Competition](#competition) as the core entity that defines a generic competitive sports event. [Competition](#competition) has several subclasses: [Multi Stage Competition](#multi-stage-competition), [Divisional Competition](#divisional-competition), [Multi Round Competition](#multi-round-competition), [Multidiscipline Competition](#multidiscipline-competition) and [Unit Competition](#unit-competition). This means that instances of these subclasses will be also considered a [Competition](#competition).

* In case the author does not know the nature of the competition, by default they should use the most generic class (i.e., [Competition](#competition)).
* A competition may categorized with more than a type. For instance 2016 Olympic Games is a [MultidisciplineCompetition](#multidisciplinecompetition) (100m, 200m, Throws, basketball, tennis, etc.) and a [DivisionalCompetition](#divisionalcompetition) (divisions are disciplines and categories).

## Overview of the model

The model is related to the competition management in Athletics. By using this model systems will be able to describe, collect, process, store and publish Athletics information.

In order to represent properly the model, the work was divided in two parts:
1. **Competitors**, organizations and stakeholders involved in the competition; and
2. **Competitions** (scheduling and results).


### Competitors and affiliation

<figure>
    ![Competitor Conceptual Model](images/competitor_model.png)
    <figcaption>Competitor Conceptual Model</figcaption> 
</figure>

<dl>
    <dt>[Competitors](#competitors)</dt>
    <dd>**[Athletes](#athlete)** or **[Teams](#teams)** that takes part in Athletics events. Athletes are defined by gender, age, nationality, and other personal information. Both athletes and teams can be affiliated to [Organizations](#organizations) such as clubs, schools, university, and/or federations.</dd>

    <dt>[Federations](#federations)</dt>
    <dd>Sports governing bodies in charge of governing and rule Athletics in specific territories. [Federations](#federations) may be attached to other higher-level federations. **[Athletes](#athlete)**, **[Teams](#teams)**, and **[Clubs](#clubs)** may be attached to federations. </dd>
</dl>

### Athletics Competitions

<figure>
    ![Competition Conceptual Model](images/competition_model.png)
    <figcaption>Athletics competition model</figcaption> 
</figure>

<dl>
    <dt>[Competition](#competition)</dt>
    <dd>Competitions are organized occasions where Athletics events are planed and take place at a specific location during a period of time. Most Athletics events are part of a bigger meeting, or competition. These competitions can be organized periodically ([Competition Series](#competition-series)), such as the Summer Olympic Games. These events may have of different nature, depending on the disciplines, schedule, competitors, and scope (e.g., championships tournaments, leagues, fund-raising road races, etc.). Athletics competitions may divided in several [Competitions](#competition) ([Divisional Competition](#divisional-competition) such as [Summer Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_Summer_Olympics) include 24 independent event disciplines for men and 23 for women); they may include several stages ([Multi Stage Competitions](#multi-stage-competition) like the Diamond League); also competitions may be composed of several disciplines ([Multi Discipline Competitions](#multidiscipline-competition) are combined events such as Decathlon).</dd>

    <dt>[Rounds](#rounds)</dt>
    <dd>Stages of Athletics competitions (e.g., qualifying rounds, semifinals, final, etc.) where competitors are distributed in groups. Rounds depend on the competition rules for each discipline, so there is a difference between rounds within timed events, and rounds in field events. Vertical jumps have different rules regarding rounds in field events.</dd>

    <dt>[Venue](#venue)</dt>
    <dd>Location where events and competitions are held.</dd>

    <dt>[Category](#category)</dt>
    <dd>Specific category of an event (e.g., Senior Men, U18 Women, etc.).</dd>

    <dt>[Field Trials Round](#field-trials-round)</dt>
    <dd>Round of Field Events is a set of [Trials](#field-trial), where athletes have different attempts to achieve their best performance in the competition.  </dd>

    <dt>[Competition Entries](#competition-entry)</dt>
    <dd>Entries in competition are those athletes or teams that take part in an Athletics event, identified by specific information such as bib number, and best performance for the specific discipline of the event. This entry information is relative to the competition and relevant for **[Results](#results)**.</dd>

    <dt>[Results](#results)</dt>
    <dd>Results is a list of competitors (entries in the competition) with their [Performances](#performance) after an event or a concrete round— It serves as ranking for each stage of the competition. Result list items will include information about the impact of the performance in the competition (i.e., records, disqualifications, competition 'under protest', etc.).</dd>

    <dt>[Performances](#performances)</dt>
    <dd>Resulting competitor's accomplishment recognized by judges after a competition round. Measurements depend on the type of discipline (i.e., running performances are measured as time, jumps and throws are measured in centimetres). It may include information about the conditions in which competitor got the performance (e.g., wind speed). </dd>

    <dt>[Field Trials](#field-trial)</dt>
    <dd>Each one of the attempts performed by athletes within a round of trials ([Field Trials Round](#field-trials-round)).</dd>
</dl>

<p>See below all the concepts and their attributes explained in detail, including the specific class and properties that serve to describe Athletics resources. Concepts include examples of implementation. </p>

| 100+ | `category:V100` | `category:M100` | `category:W100` |


### Country

Each country should be represented by an IRI that includes a unique three-character *Authority code*. It is recommended using the EU [Named Authority List (NAL) of Countries](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/authority/country/index.html), that relays on the [ISO 3166-1/alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) positions in case the country is present in the ISO standard. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are also offered.

The IRI of countries will be `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/{countrycode}`. The JSON-LD context will enable a `country` prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of the following form:

<pre class="example">
    country:{countrycode}
</pre>

For instance: `country:ZWE` for *Zimbabwe*, `country:ZAF` for *South Africa* and `country:TGO` for *Togo*.

Check the full list of authority country codes at [http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html).
